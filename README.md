# Roll

Roll is a very simple (WIP) D&D die roller written in Python 3.

## Installation

These are temporary installation instructions. I have plans to add this project to the PyPI and AUR (Arch User Repository) in the future.

Clone this repository:

```
% git clone https://github.com/mpolidori/die-roll.git
```

Add an alias to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```
alias roll="python ~/path/to/roll.py "
```

## Examples

Rolling 2d6:

```
% roll 2d6

 6
 2

 Total: 8

```

Rolling d20:

```
% roll d20 

 20

 Total: 20

```

(Nice! Nat 20!)
